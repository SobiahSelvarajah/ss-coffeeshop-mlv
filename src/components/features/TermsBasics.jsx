                That said, Terms and Conditions (“T&Cs”) are 
                a set of legally binding rules established by 
                you as the owner of this website. They define 
                the legal boundaries that govern how visitors 
                or customers may use and interact with the site. 
                T&Cs are intended to establish the legal 
                relationship between you, as the website owner, 
                and those who access or engage with the website.
                <br/>
                T&Cs should be tailored to the specific purpose 
                and nature of each website. For example, a website 
                that sells products through e-commerce transactions 
                will require different T&Cs than a website that 
                provides information only, such as a blog or 
                landing page.
                <br/>
                By setting out clear T&Cs, you can help protect 
                yourself from potential legal exposure. However, 
                legal requirements vary by jurisdiction, so it is 
                important to seek local legal advice to ensure your 
                Terms and Conditions offer appropriate protection.
